# Getting Started with Create React App

A system for managing medical images and data securely and efficiently while giving patients control over their information can be designed using blockchain technology. This type of system would store patients' digital signatures on a decentralized network and link their medical images to their digital signatures. This decentralization ensures that the images are distributed across the network, reducing the need for a central database or authority, and making the system resistant to unauthorized access. Patients would have control over who can access their medical data, which would increase transparency and trust in the healthcare system. This approach to medical image management would prioritize the patient and their data, providing a more patient-centered approach to healthcare.

This Project is implemented using Smart Contracts. It is a ReactJS Application, which employs the use of Solidity contracts.
